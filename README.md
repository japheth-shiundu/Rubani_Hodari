# Rubani_Hodari
Rubani Hodari- (An Aviator like Simulation in Python)

This Python program simulates an auto-incrementing counter with multiple rounds, each terminating at a random number within a specified range. The program features:

Eight Unique Rounds:
    Each round starts counting from 1.00 and terminates at a random number within a predefined range.

Colored Output:
    Each round's output is displayed in a specific color for better visualization.

Round Logic:

  Round 1 runs 6 times consecutively at the start.

  After Round 1, the program randomly selects and runs one of the remaining rounds.

Modular Design:
    Each round is implemented in a separate Python file, making the code easy to maintain and extend.
    You can add more rounds by editing one round file- add a unique range, and specfy the color. Also make sure to include it on you main.py list of rounds.

Requirements:
>>Python 3.x
>>colorama library (for colored output)
